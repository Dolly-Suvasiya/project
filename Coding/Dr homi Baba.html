                            He was born into a wealthy and prominent industrial Parsi family.<br>
                            He was related to Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Dorabji Tata.<br>
                            He received his early education in Bombay’s Cathedral Grammar School and entered<br>
                            Elphinstone College when he was 15 years old after passing his Senior Cambridge Examination.

                            After that, he attended the Royal Institute of Science until the year 1927<br>
                            before joining Caius College of Cambridge University. This was due to the insistence of his

                            father and his uncle Dorab Tata, who planned for Bhabha to obtain a

                            <h3 class="text"><strong>Career Homi Bhabha:-</strong></h3>

                            During his stay in Cambridge, Homi Bhabha benefited with great minds of physics and
                            interacted
                            with many physicists who played a pivotal role in the development of physics. In Cambridge,
                            Bhabha closely interacted and befriended with his fellow countrymen and influential
                            theoretical
                            physicist Raziuddin Siddiqui. With Siddiqui as his friend, his interests gradually shifted
                            to
                            theoretical physicists and in the year 1928, he directed a letter to his father and uncle
                            about
                            his interest.

                            <br><br>

                            Bhabha’s father understood his son’s predicament and agreed to finance his studies in
                            mathematics provided that he obtains first class on his Mechanical Sciences Tripos exam.
                            Bhabha appeared for the Tripos exam in June 1930 and passed with first class.

                            <br><br>

                            Later, he pursued his mathematical studies under Paul Dirac to complete the Mathematics
                            Tripos.
                            During that time, he also worked in the Cavendish Laboratory while working for his doctorate
                            in
                            theoretical physics. At that time, there were many scientific breakthroughs which were
                            occurring
                            in the laboratory.

                            <br><br>

                            During the academic year of 1931-32, Homi Bhabha was awarded the Salomons Studentship in
                            Engineering.
                            In the year 1932, he obtained first class in his Mathematical Tripos and was awarded the
                            Rouse Ball traveling studentship in mathematics. However, with Siddiqui shifting to Germany,
                            Bhabha lost his interest in theoretical physics and moved towards nuclear physics. During
                            that
                            time, he found himself conducting atomic experiments involving the subatomic energetic rays
                            directly.
                            His experiments and researches brought laurels and great contributions to the field of
                            physics
                            at that time.

                            <br><br>

                            During January 1933, Bhabha received his doctorate in nuclear physics after
                            publishing his first scientific paper titled <em>"The Absorption of Cosmic Radiation"</em>.
                            In this publication, he offered an explanation of the absorption features and electron
                            shower
                            production in cosmic rays. The paper helped him to win the Isaac Newton Studentship in the
                            year
                            1934 which he held for three years. He then completed his doctoral studies in theoretical
                            physics
                            under Ralph H. Fowler in the next year. During his studentship, he split his time working in
                            Cambridge and with
                            Niels Bohr in Copenhagen.

                            <br>

                            In the year 1935, he published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
                            Series A, in which he performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of
                            electron positron scattering. This scattering was later renamed as Bhabha scattering in
                            honor
                            of his contributions to the field. In the year 1936, they published a paper
                            <em>‘The Passage of Fast Electrons and the Theory of Cosmic Showers’.</em>
                            In the year 1937, Homi Bhabha was awarded the Senior Studentship of the 1851
                            Exhibition which helped him to continue his work in Cambridge until the outbreak of World
                            War II
                            in the year 1939.

                            <br><br>

                            On September 1939, he was in India for a brief holiday when the
                            World War II broke out and he decided not to return to England for some time.
                            He then accepted an offer to serve as the reader in the Physics department of the
                            Indian Institute of Science which was then headed by physicist C. V. Raman. He received a
                            special research grant from Sir Dorab Tata trust which he used to establish the Cosmic Ray
                            Research Unit at the institute. Later on 20th March 1941, he was elected as a fellow of the
                            Royal Society. With the help of J. R. D. Tata, Bhabha played an instrumental role in the
                            establishment of the
                            Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay.

                            <br><br>

                            During the time when Bhabha was working in the Indian Institute of Science, there was no
                            institute in India which had the necessary
                            facilities for original work in nuclear physics, cosmic rays and other frontiers of
                            knowledge in
                            physics. As such, he sent a proposal to Sir Dorabji Jamsetji Tata in March 1944 for
                            establishing
                            <em>‘A vigorous school of research in fundamental physics’</em>.

                            <br><br>

                            The trustees accepted his proposal and provided the financial responsibility for building up
                            the
                            institute. The location was chosen in Bombay and the institute names Tata Institute of
                            Fundamental Research
                            was inaugurated in the year 1945. There was also the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay was
                            established and started function in
                            the year 1954. In the same year, the Department of Atomic Energy was also established.
                            Bhabha represented India in the
                            International Atomic Energy Forums and also as a President of the United Nations Conference
                            on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva
                            in Switzerland in the year 1955. He was also elected as a foreign honorary member of the
                            American
                            Academy of Arts and Sciences in the year 1958.

                            <br><br>

                            Homi Bhabha played a key role in convincing the Congress Party’s leaders, most notably
                            Jawaharlal Nehru to start the ambitious nuclear programme. In the year 1948,
                            Nehru appointed Bhabha as the director of the nuclear programme and asked him to develop
                            nuclear
                            weapons soon after.

                            <br><br>

                            During the Conference in Switzerland in the year 1955, he intensified his lobbying for
                            developing nuclear weapons and soon after the Sino Indian War, he aggressively and publicly
                            began to call for the nuclear weapons.
                            His major contributions include the Compton scattering and R-process among others for the
                            advancement of nuclear physics.
                            Bhabha also served as the member of the Indian Cabinet’s Scientific Advisory Committee and
                            provided the pivotal role to
                            Vikram Sarabhai to set up the Indian national Committee for Space research.

                            <br><br>

                            Homi J. Bhabha died when Air India Flight 101 crashed neat
                            Mount Blanc on 24th January 1966. Many possible theories have been advanced for the air
                            crash,
                            including a conspiracy theory in which CIA was involved in order to paralyze India’s nuclear
                            program.

                            <br>

                            Homi Bhabha is regarded as the father of Indian nuclear power. He is credited with
                            formulating
                            the country’s strategy in the field of nuclear power to focus on extracting power from the
                            country’s vast thorium reserves rather than its meager uranium reserves. The approach
                            proposed
                            by Bhabha to achieve this strategic objective became the India’s three stage nuclear power
                            programme.

                            <br><br>

                            After Bhabha’s death, the Atomic Energy Establishment at Trombay was renamed
                            as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honor. Bhabha was also a painter and a classical
                            music and an opera enthusiast, besides being an amateur botanist. He encourages research in
                            electronics, space science, radio astronomy and microbiology. The famed radio telescope in
                            Ooty was his initiative and became a reality in the year 1970.

                            <br><br>

                            The Homi Bhabha Fellow-ship Council has been giving the Homi Bhabha Fellowships since the
                            year 1967.
                            Apart from these other institutions in his name include the Homi Bhabha National Institute
                            and the
                            Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education in Mumbai.
                            He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the year 1954 by the Indian Government.
