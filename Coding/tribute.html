                <li>
                    <strong>Kalpana Chawla</strong> was American astronaut who died in the Space Shuttle ‘Columbia’
                    disaster. Born in Karnal, India, she was the first woman of Indian origin to go to space. A tomboy
                    from the beginning, she developed a passion for airplanes in her early childhood. After earning a
                    Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Punjab she moved to the USA at the age of
                    twenty. There she did her Masters and PhD in Aerospace Engineering. Thereafter, she joined NASA and
                    began her career as a researcher, working on various topics first at Ames Research Center and then
                    at Overset Methods Inc. Meanwhile, she became a certified pilot with a commercial license for
                    multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes, and gliders. After becoming a US citizen in 1991, she applied for
                    the NASA Astronaut Corps, eventually joining the organization in March 1995. In May 1997, she went
                    on her first space mission, travelling for fifteen days in the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87.
                    In 2003, she travelled once again into the space aboard ill-fated Space Shuttle Columbia flight
                    STS-107 and remained in the space for about sixteen days. She died at the age of forty when the
                    Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas, sixteen minutes prior to landing.

            <h3>Career</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1988, Kalpana Chawla began her career at NASA’s Ames Research Center. There, she started working
                    on power-lift computational fluid dynamics, concentrating on the concept of vertical and/or short
                    take-off and landing. Once the project was complete, she began working on mapping of flow solvers to
                    parallel computers.
                </li>
                <li>In 1993, she was made Vice President of Overset Methods Inc. and moved to Los Altos, California,
                    with the responsibility of developing efficient techniques to perform aerodynamic optimization and
                    implementing the same. There, she formed a team of researchers and began working on simulation of
                    moving multiple body problems.
                </li>
                <li>In December 1994, she was selected to join NASA Astronaut Corps, a unit of the National Aeronautics
                    and Space Administration. Its job is to select, train, and provide astronauts not only for U.S., but
                    also for international space missions and is based at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston.
                </li>
                <li>In March 1995, she joined Johnson Space Center as an Astronaut Candidate in the 15th Group of
                    Astronauts. There, she underwent rigorous training for one year, at the end of which she was
                    assigned to the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches to work as crew representative.

                </li>
                <li>As crew representative, she was assigned to work on the development of Robotic Situational Awareness
                    Displays. Besides, she was also assigned to test space shuttle control software in the Shuttle
                    Avionics Integration Laboratory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>First Space Travel</h3>
                </li>
                <li>In November 1996, Chawla was assigned to Space Shuttle Columbia flight, STS-87 as Mission Specialist
                    1 and the primary Robotic Arm Operator. It was launched on November 19, 1997 from Launch Complex 39B
                    of the Kennedy Space Center.</li>
                <li>During her first mission, Chawla spent around 15 days (376 hours, 34 minutes) in space, making 252
                    orbits around the earth, traveling a total distance of 6.5 million miles. The mission returned to
                    the earth on December 5, 1997.
                </li>
                <li>Among other experiments, STS-87 mainly focused on how the weightless in the space affects physical
                    processes. They also tested EVA tools and procedures and observed the outer atmospheric layers of
                    the sun.
                </li>
                <li>Chawla was especially responsible for deploying a Spartan satellite, which developed a snag,
                    requiring two members of the crew, Winston Scott and Takao Doi, to take a spacewalk and manually
                    capture it. Later it was found that there was an error in the software interfaces, which absolved
                    her of negligence.
                </li>
                <li>In January 1998, after the completion of post flight activities, Chawla joined the Astronaut Offices
                    Crew Systems, serving as crew representative for the shuttle and station flight crew equipment.
                    Subsequently, she served as lead for Astronaut Offices Crew Systems and Habitability section.
                </li>


                <li>
                    <h3>Second Space Travel</h3>
                </li>
                <li>In 2000, Kalpana Chawla was selected as a Mission Specialist for STS-107, the final flight of Space
                    Shuttle Columbia. It was a scientific mission and included a small laboratory, christened as ‘space
                    hab’. The laboratory was seven meters in length, five meters in width and four meters in height.
                </li>
                <li>Initially it was planned that the mission would take off on January 11, 2001; but was delayed 18
                    times due to technical problems and scheduling conflicts. Eventually it was launched on January 16,
                    2003 from Kennedy Space Center's LC-39-A. But the launching was not without any hitch.
                </li>
                <li>81.7 seconds after the launch, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external
                    tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter, damaging it considerably. At that time, STS-107 was at
                    an altitude of about 65,600 feet, traveling at a speed of 1,650 miles per hour.
                </li>
                <li>The space shuttle remained in the space for 15 days, 22 hours, 20 minutes, 32 seconds. During this
                    period, the mission crew worked twenty-four hours a day in two alternating shifts, performing nearly
                    80 experiments, focusing not only on space science, but also on health and safety of the astronauts.
                </li>
                <li>After a successful trip in the space, STS-107 re-entered the earth’s atmosphere on February 1, 2003.
                    But the crew never reached home because 16 minutes before the scheduled landing at Kennedy Space
                    Center, the space craft disintegrated over Texas, killing each of them.
                </li>

                    <h3>Awards & Achievements
                    </h3>
                </li>
                <li>Kalpana Chawla was posthumously awarded Congressional Space Medal of Honor, NASA Space Flight Medal
                    and NASA Distinguished Service Medal.

                    <h3>Personal Life & Legacy
                    </h3>
                </li>
                <li>In 1983, Kalpana Chawla married Jean-Pierre Harrison, a French-American flying instructor and a
                    author, knowns for his two books: ‘The Edge of Time: The Authoritative Biography of Kalpana Chawla’
                    and ‘Principles of Helicopter Flight’. The couple did not have any children. In 1991, she became an
                    American citizen.
                </li>
                <li>Chawla died on February 1, 2003 at around 9 AM, when STS-107 disintegrated over Texas. The damage
                    caused at the time of its launch allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy its internal
                    wing structure when it re-entered the earth’s atmosphere, eventually leading to the disintegration
                    of the spacecraft.
                </li>
                <li>The mortal remains of all the crew members were later identified. Chawla’s remains were cremated and
                    her ashes were scattered at National Park in Utah in accordance to her wish.
                </li>
                <li>After her death, ‘51826 Kalpanachawla’, an Eoan asteroid located in the outer region of the asteroid
                    belt and ‘Chawla Hill’, one of the seven peaks in the Columbia Hill chain on planet Mars, have been
                    named in her honor.
                </li>
                <li>In India, MetSat-1, the first satellite in the meteorological series of satellites called MetSat,
                    was renamed ‘Kalpana-1’. NASA also dedicated a supercomputer in her honor.
                </li>
                <li>In 2004, the University of Texas opened a dormitory named Kalpana Chawla Hall in her honor. The
                    girls’ hostel in University of Punjab has also been named after her. Apart from these, many other
                    colleges and universities in India have renamed their student dormitories and hostels after her.
                </li>
                <li>Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College (KCGMC) in Karnal and Kalpana Chawla Planetarium in
                    Jyotisar, Kurukshetra also carry her legacy. In addition, numerous awards and honors have also been
                    established in her name.
                </li>
                <li>74th Street in Jackson Heights in New York City has been renamed ‘Kalpana Chawla Way’ in her honor.
                    In Mumbai, India, a crossroad in Borivli has been renamed Kalpana Chawla Chowk.
